		<h1>part 1: The Begining</h1>
		<p>Once upon a time in my hometown, i dreamt of inventing a mathematical formula.</p>
		<h2>part 2: When i begin to gather some theories</h2>
		<p>I started gathering some theories and solving more qeustion so as to bring my dream and imagination into reality.</p>
		<h3>part 3: I started associating with successful mathematicians</h3>
		<p>This phase encouraged me to mingle and associate with scientist, philosophers and mathematician that have invented many theories and formulas that are used today so i could know what  i am likely to encouter in the process of the invention.</p>
		<h4> part 4: I encounterd many circumstances</h4>
		<p>in this phase, i was so tired and frustruated because all the theories i gathered towards inventing a formula are leading to errors, i decided to give up.<p>
		<h5> part 5: i met a succesful inventor who encouraged me</h5>
		<p>in the process of giving up, i was opportune to meet a great inventor and also a philosopher called Albert Einstein. So he gave me an advice and told me part of his story. he said he failed more than a thousand time before he could successfully invent a practising theory that failure is not a denial but delay.</p>
		<h6> part 6: i prayed to God for more knowledge and understanding</h6>
		<p>i prayed to God for more knowledge, and i woke up one night and discover that my brain is working ten times the normal way. i started meditating about many theories and i later invent a formula to solve Quadratic Equation. later on, i was bothered about the name i could give to it. Immediately i remembered that God intervene for me then i named it Almighty Formula.</p>
