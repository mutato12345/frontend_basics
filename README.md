I'm learning frontend development because i want to build beautiful and interactive websites and user interface. My goal is to become skilled in HTML, CSS, and Javascript so I can bring ideas to life in web. I'm motivated by the creativity and problem-solving that frontend development offers, and I'm committed to growing my skills one step at a time.
